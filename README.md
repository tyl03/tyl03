## Hi there 👋

I’m a software engineering student who enjoys turning ideas into real, working software.

I’m usually most interested when things are complex or challenging, especially problems that require careful thinking rather than flashy interfaces.

My main interests are machine learning and backend development.  
I value clean, understandable code and like knowing *why* things work, not just that they do.

Always eager to learn and improve.
